Proposal
My final Project Proposal:

My project proposal is a site that helps create excel formulas using natural language. Essentially, I will have a database of some sort with the most commonly used excel formulas, such as VLookup, Xmatch etc. and a user will be able to put in what they need the formula to do in natural language and my program will convert that into the formula that they need which they can copy and paste into excel. An example would be if someone needed a vlookup formula to search across a table in a sheet called ‘tab1’ and get data into ‘tab2’ they would just fill out the sheet name, data range, match requirement and anything else needed for the formula in plain language. My program would then convert that directly into the excel formula which the user can plug into their excel workbook directly. 

To Do:

By the end of week 4: 

    I will have a database (hosted in excel for simplicity and cost) with the top 45 used formulas in excel
    I will do research and establish a flow of how my site will work. i.e. what would the inputs from the user need to be, what is the flow      from user input to retrieving data to then how can that data be used to create a formula for the user

By the end of week 5 (midterm week):

    I will have created my UI for the site which will be a simple UI so shouldn't take too much time to design  
    
By the end of week 6:

    I will create my initial classes for inputs and outputs
    
By the end of week 7:

    Create requirments/methods for all formulas. This might spill over into week 8
    
By the end of week 8:  

    Link my UI to the functionality of my project so that a user can enter their desired inputs and get a working formula
    
By the end of week 9 (finals week):

    Testing and final tweaks.
